            Since so much our social lives are lived online, maybe it makes sense for
             our art collections to reside online, too.

                academic researcher
            </a>
            , developer of artistic technology and amateur artist, I was quite skeptical about crypto art when 
            <a href="https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/1/14/what-is-cryptoart">
                I first read about it several years ago
            </a>
            . 
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I follow a community of artists on social media, and some of the artists there whom I respect,
             like Mario Klingemann and Jason Bailey, 
             <a href="https://twitter.com/quasimondo/status/1310612476011175936?s=20">

                advocated for
            </a>
             crypto art. Within the past few months, activity and prices seemed to snowball.
              I started thinking it deserves to be taken seriously. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Then the Beeple sale happened.
            </p>
            <p>
                On March 11, Beeple, a computer science graduate whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, 
                auctioned a piece of crypto art at Christie’s 
                <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/11/976141522/
                beeple-jpg-file-sells-for-69-million-setting-crypto-art-record">
                    for US$69 million
                </a>
                .
            </p>
            <img src="/img/2/2.3.jpg" alt="Twitter reference"/>
            <p>
                The winning bidder is now named in a digital record that confers ownership. This record, called a 
                <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/explained-non-fungible-tokens-nfts-010049576.html">
                    nonfungible token
                </a>
                , or NFT, is stored in a shared global database. This database is decentralized using blockchain,
                 so that no single individual or company controls the database. As long as the specific blockchain
                  survives in the world, anyone can read or access it, and no one can change it.
            </p>
            <p>
                But “ownership” of crypto art confers no actual rights, other than being able to say that you
                    own the work. You don’t own the copyright, you don’t get a physical print, and anyone can look at
                    the image on the web. There is merely a record in a public database saying that you own the work
                    – really, it says you own the work at a specific URL.
            </p>
            <p>
                So why would anyone buy crypto art – let alone spend millions on what’s essentially
                 a link to a JPEG file?
            </p>
            <h2>
                Art is inherently social
            </h2>
            <p>
                It might be helpful to think about crypto art in the context of why people buy original works of art.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some people buy art for their homes, hoping to incorporate it into
                 their living spaces for pleasure and inspiration.
            </p>
            <p>
                But art also plays many important social roles. The art in your home communicates your interests and
                 tastes. Artworks can spark conversation, whether they’re in museums or homes. People form communities
                  around their passion for the arts, whether it’s through museums and galleries, or magazines and
                  websites. Buying work supports the artists and the arts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then there are collectors. People get into collecting all sorts of things – model trains, commemorative 
                plates, rare vinyl LPs, sports memorabilia – and, like other collectors, art collectors are passionate 
                about trying to hunt down those rare pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps the most visible form of art collecting today, and the one that drives so much public 
                discussion about art, is the art purchased for millions of dollars – the pieces by 
                <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/
                0,28804,1917097_1917096_1917100,00.html">
                    Picasso
                </a>
                 and 
                 <a href="https://www.clc.sllf.qmul.ac.uk/?p=391">
                    Damien Hirst
                </a>
                 traded by the ultrawealthy. This is still social: Whether they’re at Sotheby’s auctions or museum 
                 board dinners, wealthy art collectors mingle, meet and talk about who bought what.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, I think many people buy art strictly as an investment, 
                <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42011989">
                    hoping that it will appreciate in value
                </a>
                .
            </p>
            <h2>
                Is crypto art really that different?
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you look at the reasons people buy art, only one of them – buying art for your home
                 – has to do with the physical work. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Every other reason for buying art that I listed could apply to crypto art.
            </p>

                You can build your own virtual gallery online and share it with other people online. You can convey your
                 tastes and interests through your virtual gallery and support artists by buying their work. You can
                  participate in a community: Some crypto artists, who have felt excluded by the mainstream art world,
                   say they

                While Beeple’s big sale made headlines, most crypto art sales are much more affordable, in the tens or
                 hundreds of dollars. This supports a much larger community than just a select few artists.

                Value as a social construct
            </h2>
            <p>
                Aside from the visual pleasure of physical objects, nearly all the value art offers is, in some way, a
                 social construct. This does not mean that art is interchangeable, or that the historical significance
                  and technical skill of a
                   <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/rembrandt-master-printmaker-cincinnati-art-museum/

                   Rembrandt
                </a>
                 is imaginary. It means that the value we place on these attributes is a choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When someone pays 
                    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/arts/jeff-koons-rabbit-auction.html">
                        $90 million for a metal balloon animal made by Jeff Koons
                    </a>
                    , it’s hard to believe that the work has that much “intrinsic” value. Even if the materials and
                     craftsmanship are quite good, surely some of those millions are simply buying the right to say
                      “I bought a Koons. And I spent a lot of money on it.” If you just want an artfully made metal
                       balloon animal, there are cheaper ways to get one.

                    Conversely, the conceptual art tradition has long separated the object itself from the value of the
                     work. Maurizio Cattelan 
                     <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/maurizio-cattelan-banana-explained-1732773">
                        sold a banana taped to a wall for six figures, twice
                    </a>
                    ; the value of the work was not in the banana or in the duct tape, nor in the way that the two were
                     attached, but
                      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/08/arts/design/
                      a-critics-defense-of-cattelan-banana-.html">
                         in the story and drama around the work
                    </a>
                    . Again, the buyers weren’t really buying a banana, they were buying the right to say they
                     “owned” this artwork.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on your point of view, crypto art could be the ultimate manifestation of conceptual art’s
                     separation of the work of art from any physical object. It is pure conceptual abstraction,
                      applied to ownership.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, crypto art could be seen as reducing art to the purest form of buying and selling
                     for conspicuous consumption.

                    In Victor Pelevin’s satirical novel “
                    <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/286440/homo-zapiens-by-victor-pelevin/">
                        Homo Zapiens
                    </a>,
                    ” the main character visits an art exhibition where only the names and sale prices of the works are
                     shown. When he says he doesn’t understand – where are the paintings themselves? – it becomes clear
                      that this isn’t the point. Buying and selling is more important than the art.
                </p>
                <p>This story was satire. But crypto art takes this one step further. If the point of ownership is to
                     be able to say you own the work, why bother with anything but a receipt?

                      I could make my own NFT claiming that I own the Mona Lisa, and record it to the blockchain, and

                <p>
                    In crypto art, there is an implicit contract that what you’re buying is unique. The artist makes
                     only one of these tokens, and the one right you get when you buy crypto art is to say that you own
                      that work. No one else can. Note, though, that this is not a legal right, nor is there any
                       enforcement other than social mores. Nonetheless, the value comes from the artist creating
                        scarcity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the same thing that’s happened in the art world 
                    <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-specialist-buying-limited-editions">
                        ever since photographers and printmakers had to figure out how to sell their work
                    </a>
                    . In the world of photography, a limited-edition print is considered more valuable than an unlimited
                     edition; the fewer prints in the edition, the more valuable they are. Knowing that you have one of
                      a few prints personally made and signed by the artist gives you an emotional connection to the
                       artist that a mass-produced print doesn’t.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This connection could be even weaker in digital art. But what you are buying is still, in part, a
                     connection with the artist. Artists sometimes 
                     <a href="https://twitter.com/MattKaneArtist/status/1370059188660011009?s=20">

                    </a>
                    , which may strengthen this emotional connection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    A bubble bound to burst?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personally, I want to buy only art I can hang on my walls, so I have no interest in buying crypto
                     art. There are also environmental costs.
                      <a href="https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053">
                            Certain blockchains used for crypto art are really bad for the climate

                    , because they require computations that consume staggering amounts of energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That said, if buying it right now gives you pleasure – and you enjoy sharing what you’ve bought and
                     the community around it and you’re using

                <p>
                    If you’re buying it for some future reward, however, that’s risky. Will people care about your
                     personal virtual gallery in the future? Will you care? Will crypto art even be a thing in a
                      few years?

                <p>
                    As an investment, it just seems inconceivable to me that the higher prices reflect true value,
                     in the sense of these works having higher resale value in the long term. As in the traditional
                      art world, there are a lot more works being sold than could ever possibly be considered
                       significant in a generation’s time.

                    And, in the crypto world, we’re seeing highly volatile prices, a sudden frenzy of interest, and huge
                     sums being paid for things that seem, on the surface, not to have the slightest bit of value at
                      all, such as

                        Much of this energy seems to be driven by price speculation
                    </a>

                    . The cryptocurrencies that drive crypto art are often considered highly speculative.

                    I have no doubt that, right now, there’s a big NFT bubble.

                    There have been lots of bubbles before –

                     – objects that were flying off the shelves one year and then piled up in landfills the next. And,
                      in a bubble,

                        a few headline-making winners get rich, while a whole lot of others lose their shirts
                    </a>
                    . Even if crypto art lasts, maybe the particular artist or platform where you’re buying won’t be
                     popular in the future.

                    My feelings about crypto art aside, I do believe that art is, fundamentally, a social activity.
                     The more our social lives are lived online, the more it may make sense for some people to have
                      their art collections online, too – whether or not blockchain is involved.
